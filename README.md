### 🎯 About Me

I’m a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and End-to-End BI Specialist focused on solving real business problems.

I turn data into strategic decisions — and above all, into measurable impact.

My approach doesn’t start with tools, it starts with the **problem**. Companies don’t need just charts — they need **clear answers to critical questions**. That’s why I specialize in the full lifecycle of analytics, from collection to prediction.

### 💼 What I Do

- **Smart Data Collection**  
  I go to the source — in the field or in systems — and build data input pipelines that ensure data is born clean and reliable.

- **Automation & Data Engineering**  
  I design pipelines that clean, validate, and centralize data to eliminate manual processes and ensure up-to-date, trustworthy information.

- **Business Intelligence**  
  I create dashboards that tell stories and provide actionable answers — not just pretty charts.

- **Predictive Analytics**  
  When the past isn’t enough, I apply machine learning to forecast what’s next and support data-driven decisions.

- **Business Impact**  
  Every solution I deliver drives ROI, increases productivity, or cuts costs — always tied to strategic goals.
